# HCat-GNet (Homogeneous Catalyst Graph Neural Network)

The **HCat-GNet** (Homogeneous Catalyst Graph Neural Network) is an open-source platform intended for virtual evaluation of homogeneous catalysts selectivity. In principle, the software presented in this repository should be useful and accurate to predict any target property that wants to be optimised in a process accelerated by an homogenous catalyst.
