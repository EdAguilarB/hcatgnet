# HCat-GNet: Homogeneous Catalyst Graph Neural Network

## Overview
HCat-GNet (Homogeneous Catalyst Graph Neural Network) is a cutting-edge, open-source platform designed to facilitate the virtual evaluation and optimization of homogeneous catalysts. Utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), HCat-GNet predicts the selectivity of homogeneous catalytic reactions based solely on SMILES representations of participant molecules, significantly speeding up the process of ligand optimization in asymmetric catalysis.

## Features
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Delivers highly accurate predictions of enantioselectivity for metal-ligand catalyzed asymmetric reactions.
- **Interpretability**: Provides insights into how different ligand modifications affect reaction outcomes, enhancing human understanding and guiding experimental design.
- **Flexibility**: Agnostic to reaction type, capable of handling a variety of catalytic processes without the need for domain-specific adjustments.
